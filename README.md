## Where would you end up if you packed your bags, hit the road and never looked back? We can show you.

### Required: Fitbit Account


Youre on your way home from work and your fitbit alert goes off: "Congratuatulations! you've hit your daily steps!" For a moment you marvel about how you managed to get to a number as high as 15 000, just by taking one step at a time. 

But what if all that hard work had translated to a different goal - what if your fitbit hadn't reset to zero each night, after setting it up on day 01? 

And what if you had just started walking, without turning back... **_Where could you have made it to?_**

According to the [Uganda Bureau of Statistics 2014 Census](http://www.ubos.org/2016/03/24/census-2014-final-results/), children have to walk an average 12km per day (6km to and from) for access to education.

Data and technology can put a lot in perspective. We wanted to exploit the natural craving for personalized data visualization to better tell a story, through contrast, about the extent Ugandan children have to walk to get an education.
